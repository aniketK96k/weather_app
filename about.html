    <p>What is a weather API? Weather APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are services that provide real-time
        access to weather data and forecasts. These APIs enable developers to build applications for their users that
        can access the latest weather information from a variety of sources</p>
    <p>Before we can start accessing weather data in javascript, we need to find a weather API that we can use. Online, a
        variety of weather APIs are accessible; some are cost-free, while others require a paid subscription.
        OpenWeatherMap, Dark Sky, and Weather Underground are some examples of well-liked weather APIs. You must
        register for an API key after selecting a weather API. You can access the API and obtain data using this key.
        You must consult the documentation for the particular API you are using because every API has a different
        procedure for getting an API key. You can begin utilising the API in your JS code after you have an API key.
        Installing any required libraries or modules comes first.Most weather APIs use HTTP to provide data, so you will
        likely need to install a library such as requests or urllib to make HTTP requests in JS.</p>
